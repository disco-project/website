Matthias received his Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Technical University of Munich in August 2018. His focus was on distributed Systems on the factory floor.

During an exchange semester at the Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan in Sweden, he gained interest in the field of decentralized systems.
